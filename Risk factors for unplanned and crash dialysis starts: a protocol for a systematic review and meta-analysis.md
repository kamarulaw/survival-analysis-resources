## Risk factors for unplanned and crash dialysis starts: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis

##### **A. O. Molnar , S. Hiremath, P. A. Brown, A. Akbari**

### Definitions
- **Electronic Health Records (EHR)**: the systemized collection of patient and population electronically-stored health information in a digital format.  These records can be shared in a Digital format
- **GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)**: is a measure of the function of the kidneys.  The test measures the level of creatine in the blood and uses the result in a formula to calculate a number that reflects how well the kidneys are functioning
 
### Background
- Studies show that the prevalence of CKD in the USA and Canada have increased over the past decade, likely due to a higher prevalence of risk factors for CKD, such as diabetes and hypertension, and an aging population.  Although showing signs of stabilization, the annual growth of dialysis programs worldwide over the past two decades has ranged between 6 and 12 %
- Unfortunately, many patients will “crash” onto dialysis or initiate dialysis in an unplanned fashion
- A patient is labeled as having a crash dialysis start when he or she is referred late to a nephrologist and therefore has minimal or no nephrology care prior to starting dialysis
- The criteria used to define an unplanned dialysis initiation also differ across studies

### Methods/design

#### Objectives
- Authors will conduct a systematic review with a focus on both crash and unplanned dialysis starts
- The first objective will be to determine patient risk factors for crash and unplanned dialysis starts
- Secondary objectives will be to determine the m most commonly used criteria to define both crash and unplanned dialysis starts and to determine outcomes associated with crash and unplanned dialysis starts.  The primary outcome of interest will be mortality
- Secondary outcomes of interest will include quality of life, number of hospitalizations, duration of hospitalization, and cost

#### Search strategy
- A comprehensive search strategy will be conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library with the assistance of a librarian experienced in systematic reviews
